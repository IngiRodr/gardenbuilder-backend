# Contributing

We would love some help, especially for [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)!

### General Code Contributions

There are a number of [issues](https://github.com/capndave/gardenbuilder-api/issues) that we would love your help with. Many of them are fairly easy and are tagged as ` good first issue`. Most are things that I (capndave), just haven't gotten around to yet. Feel free to fork, work on, and submit a pull request for anything you see an issue for.

If the issue you want to work on is a spelling or grammar mistake, or a documentation issue, feel free to make a pull request with your changes (without submitting an issue first)

For all other changes, please submit an issue before submitting a pull request! Please reference a given issue in cases where a related pull request is made.

### Further Involvement

If you are interested in ok-ing pull requests, co-managing this repo or anything else beyond occasional contributions, please email me at capndavet@gmail.com. I'd love your help!
