# Contributing
* __Ensure no one is working on the issue you want to work on & contributors must have the issue assigned for which they are submitting Pull Request.__
* You can send pull requests directly also but for only minor documentation updates.

### Submitting Issues
Please submit issues liberally. Since this application is under development you can feel free to add issues for any incomplete part of the application, as you imagine it would be implemented best.

### Documentation Updates
Minor changes to documentation can be submitted as a pull request without making an issue first.

### General Code Contributions

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make in an [issue](https://github.com/capndave/gardenbuilder-api/issues). There are also a number of preexisting [issues](https://github.com/capndave/gardenbuilder-api/issues) that we would love your help with. Many of them are fairly easy and are tagged as ` good first issue`. Most are things that we just haven't gotten around to yet. Before working on something, please:

- [x] Ensure that no one is working on the issue by checking that no one is listed in the Assignees field of a particular issue (generally on the upper-right hand corner of the issue screen)
- [x] If no contributor is already assigned, express your interest in working on the issue by writing a comment for that issue
- [x] Wait for a project maintainer to assign you the issue before you start working on it.

Generally speaking, the first person who expresses interest in working on an issue will be assigned. We may ignore pull requests from those who submit them without being assigned to work on the issue, particularly if someone else expressed interest in working on the issue before them.

Once you are assigned to work on an issue, please fork, work on it, and submit a pull request that references the related issue.
